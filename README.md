Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio!
I'm a WEB DESIGNER.

## About me

Hi! My name is Ekampreet Kaur. I am from Punjab, India, and after completing my senior secondary education in Non-Medical my guardians sent me to Canada to pursue my higher studies. Currently, I am a student in "Interactive Media Design" at Fanshawe College, London, Ontario. At the same time, I am working as a Security Guard with Paladin Security Company in London, Ontario.
Furthermore, I have great knowledge about distinct software and how to use them as well.
Paradoxically, I am on social media such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Github, and many more.
Moreover, the role of a UI/UX designer involves creating and improving the user interface and overall user experience of digital products such as websites, mobile apps, and software
